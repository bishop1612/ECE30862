						Using notify()

Question 1)
buf :
Wait Queue: C1
Blocked Queue: 

Question 2)
buf : c
Wait Queue: 
Blocked Queue: C1

Question 2)
buf : 
Wait Queue: C1
Blocked Queue: 

There is no character in the buffer.
After C2 gets the character and returns the lock, C1 acquires the lock and gets put back in wait since the buffer is empty.
Would have produced an exception.

						Using notifyAll()

Question 1)
buf : c
Wait Queue: P2 P3
Blocked Queue: 

Question 2)
buf :
Wait Queue: P2 P3
Blocked Queue: 

Question 3)
buf :
Wait Queue:  C2 C3 P3
Blocked Queue: P2

Question 4)
buf : d
Wait Queue:  C2 C3 P3
Blocked Queue: 


Question 5)
buf : d
Wait Queue:  C2 C3 
Blocked Queue: P3

Cannot be woken up by notify anymore.
The d character would have been removed, the putter would have put its character, then the other getter would have removed that character.
